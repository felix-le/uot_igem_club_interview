# Here is the animation task:
I have attached an SVG file to this email, and I would like you to create a webpage where the SVG is animated (var time). Please send back the html/css/js file as an attachment, or display it on API such as https://codepen.io/ before March 7th.

The SVG consists of a recreated scene from Super Mario, where three of our research subteam members carrying an icon representing their team.

1. Mario with a pipette represents our Wet Lab team: moving like Mario
2. Yoshi with a laptop represents our Dry Lab team: moving like Yoshi
3. Peach with a megaphone represents our Business and Ethics team: moving like Peach
4. Plastics bottle represents our project on plastics degradation: absolute position moving up and down
5. igemto logo pole represent our club: moving up and down while attached to the bottom (scale x and y)
6. Bullet bill moving towards Mario, Yoshi, and Peach, who in contrast will dodge the bullet.
Bonus details: hand movement of the three characters

I would like you to animate all the individual elements in the graphic following the Super Mario game. Example movement video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYYIfd6NgzI&ab_channel=NewSuperMarioBros.UChannel

Let me know if you have questions. Thanks again for your interest in joining our group!
